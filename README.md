ImgurDL
=======
Version 0.0.5:

Loadur (Previously ImgurDL) was originally created in 2010 so I could easily download galleries and albums from [Imgur](http://imgur.com). This was before Imgur made a public API available so instead of handling data from imgur in an easy format like [JSON](http://hg.pidgin.im/pidgin/main). Instead of doing something so simple I had to write an [HTML](http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_intro.asp) spider to allow me to extract images from an Imgur gallery.

We are currently migrating the backend away from using the old web spider and towards using the "Official" [Imgur API](https://api.imgur.com/). This should make Loadur easier to use and make the Imgur folks happy that we aren't slamming their servers like we used to in the good ol' days...

Originally created to download galleries from http://imgur.com. This was before they had a public API. API support is being added.
