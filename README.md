ImgurDL
=======
Loadur (previously ImgurDL) is a [Java Swing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_%28Java%29) application that allows you to easily download galleries and albums from [Imgur](http://imgur.com). Loadur, originally known as [ImgurDL](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=ImgurDL) has been downloaded and used by tens of thousands of people from all over the globe.

Loadur was originally created in 2010 so I could easily download galleries and albums from Imgur. This was before Imgur made a public API available so instead of handling data from imgur in an easy format like [JSON](http://hg.pidgin.im/pidgin/main). Instead of doing something so simple I had to write an [HTML](http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_intro.asp) spider to allow me to extract images from an Imgur gallery.

We are currently migrating the backend away from using the old web spider and towards using the "Official" [Imgur API](https://api.imgur.com/). This should make Loadur easier to use and make the Imgur folks happy that we aren't slamming their servers like we used to in the good ol' days...

Loadur is now [Public Domain](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_domain) software. This means you can do pretty much anything (only legal things) that you want to with it. You can modify it, rename it, repackage it and start your own app development company with it. You could always check out the code, make improvements and then [send](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) those improvements back to me. Then anyone that uses it later will be using your improvements! The only thing you can't do with this software is steal it, because I'm giving it to you. [Here](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) you can have this. If you wanted to leave my name in the source I wouldn't mind. Some future employer might see it and want to hire me because of my stunning [genius](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect). 

I could have left Loadur [proprietary](http://www.gnu.org/proprietary/proprietary.en.html) and attempted to make more money off of it, but I think that making it Open Source and releasing it into the public domain will cause this software to be of more use to, and more effective to the people who use and develop it.
